        "is there a cure ?": "Currently, there is no cure for Parkinson's, but treatments can help manage symptoms.",
        "how is it diagnosed ?": "Diagnosis is based on medical history, symptoms, and neurological examinations.",
        "can it be prevented ?": "There is no guaranteed prevention, but a healthy lifestyle may lower the risk.",
        "what are the treatment options ?": "Treatment includes medication, therapy, and in some cases, surgical intervention like deep brain stimulation.",
        "what causes parkinson's ?": "The exact cause is unknown, but genetic and environmental factors are believed to play a role.",
        "who is at risk ?": "Risk factors include age, family history, exposure to toxins, and head injuries.",
        "does stress worsen parkinsonâ€™s ?": "Yes, stress can exacerbate symptoms, making tremors and movement issues more pronounced.",
